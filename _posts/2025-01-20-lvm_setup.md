Welcome! In this guide, I will walk you through the process of creating logical volumes using the Linux Volume Manager (LVM), formatting them, and setting them up for persistent use.

The reason I am following this approach is that I have a 7TB storage drive and want to partition it and logically separate the storage for different uses. Please note that this method may not be ideal for everyone, as LVMs created through the shell are not directly accessible via the Proxmox web GUI. For my setup, I’m using a physical RAID card with three drives configured in RAID 5.

### Here’s the plan:

* Formatting and Mounting LVMs
* Creating Physical Volumes, Volume Groups, and Logical Volumes (LVs)
* Adding them as directories in Proxmox

### Partition Summary:
 - 6 TB partition: Primary space for VMs, backups, containers, and other items.
 - 1 TB partition: Reserved for future needs.
 - Create 2 Volume Groups


#### <u> Table below will show you the layout </u>

| Logical Volume | Size  | Purpose          | Vol Group   |
|----------------|-------|------------------|-------------|
|lv_vms          | 2.5TB | Virtual Machines | vg_data     |
|lv_containers   | 500GB | LXC Containers   | vg_data     |
|lv_backups      | 1.0TB | Backups          | vg_data     |
|lv_nas          | 1.5TB | File Storage     | vg_data     |
|lv_logs         | 500GB | Log Files        | vg_data     |
|lv_storage      | 1.5TB | Add Storage      | vg_storage  |


### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure that the drives are added and partitoned based on your needs
you can view the list of disk by using

```bash
lsblk # This will list all the available drives

#Output shown below  -- DO NOT RUN BELOW
NAME               MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda                  8:0    0   931G  0 disk
├─sda1               8:1    0  1007K  0 part
├─sda2               8:2    0     1G  0 part /boot/efi
└─sda3               8:3    0   930G  0 part
  ├─pve-swap       252:0    0     8G  0 lvm  [SWAP]
  ├─pve-root       252:1    0    96G  0 lvm  /
sdb                  8:16   0   7.3T  0 disk # This will be partitioned to 6TB & 1TB
```
you can create the partition by :

````bash
#identify the name of the drive on your machine and change below, here we will use sdb
fdisk /dev/sdb
````
 - Press n to create a new partition.
 - 1 for first partition or use default values
 - Use defaults for the entire disk, here since I need two partition I will use +6T for first partition
 - and continue with the defaults for the second partition
 - Press w to write changes.

View the created partitions by using 
````bash
fdisk -l /dev/sdb #Enter your drive name
#Output shown below  -- DO NOT RUN BELOW
Device           Start         End     Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sdb1         2048 12884903935 12884901888    6T Linux filesystem
/dev/sdb2  12884903936 15625877503  2740973568  1.3T Linux filesystem
````


Before creating the logical volumes, confirm that :
#### 1. LVM is installed 

```bash
sudo apt install lvm2 
```
#### 2. Initialize the physical volume and create volume group

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 #here I have used two drives in a single line 
pvscan #This will list the created physical volumes
```
Once you have confirmed that the phsical volumes have been created, create volume groups by using the below commands

```bash
vgcreate vg_data /dev/sdb1 #Creating Volume group on sdb1 6TB
vgcreate vg_storage /dev/sdb2 #Creating Volume group on sdb2 1.3+TB

#Output shown below -- DO NOT RUN BELOW
root@DVPROX01:~# vgcreate vg_data /dev/sdb1
  Volume group "vg_data" successfully created
root@DVPROX01:~# vgcreate vg_storage /dev/sdb2
  Volume group "vg_storage" successfully created
```

#### 3.Check the space

```bash 
vgs #check the free coloumn to confirm that there is enough space
```

### 2.Create Logical Volumes

- Creating Logical volumes with the specific size, see table above for the sizing chart

<b> To create Logical volume with the size of 1TB</b>

``` bash
lvcreate --name lv_vms --size 2.5T vg_data #Create logical volume named lv_vms

```
- name lv_vms: Specifies the name of the logical volume as lv_vms.
- size 2.5T: Allocates 2.5 terabytes to the logical volume.
- vg_data: The name of the volume group where the LV will be created.


likewise I will be creating the rest of the logical volumes, however for the last volume, we will use the remaining 100% of space. To use it the same way, see below -

```bash

> lvcreate --name #NameOfLogicalVolume --size #sizehere #VolumeGroupHere

lvcreate --name lv_containers --size 500GB vg_data
lvcreate --name lv_backups --size 1T vg_data
lvcreate --name lv_nas --size 1.5T vg_data

#For the remaining space, I want to create lv_logs
lvcreate --name lv_logs -l 100%FREE vg_data
```
 - -l 100%FREE: Allocates 100% of the available space in the VG to the logical volume.

 For the other volume group, vg_storage, I want to use the entire space as one LV

 ```bash
 lvcreate --name lv_storage -l 100%FREE vg_storage #here I have used the volume group name vg_storage
 ```
To view all the created Logical volumes

```bash
lvscan #To get a summarized view
lvdisplay #to get more detailed view

##Output shown
root@DVPROX01:~# lvscan
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg_storage/lv_storage' [<1.28 TiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg_data/lv_vms' [2.50 TiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg_data/lv_containers' [500.00 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg_data/lv_backups' [1.00 TiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg_data/lv_nas' [1.50 TiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/vg_data/lv_logs' [<524.00 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/pve/data' [<793.80 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/pve/swap' [8.00 GiB] inherit #System
  ACTIVE            '/dev/pve/root' [96.00 GiB] inherit #System
```

### 3.Formatting the Logical Volumes

Once the LV is created, it needs to be formatted with a filesystem. For example, to format the LV with the ext4 filesystem:
Replace the path with your volume group and logical volume name
```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/lv_vms 
#Here replace vg_data and lv_vms to match your volume names
```
```bash
#Output shown be as below  -- DO NOT RUN BELOW
root@DVPROX01:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/lv_containers
mke2fs 1.47.0 (5-Feb-2023)
Creating filesystem with 131072000 4k blocks and 32768000 inodes
Filesystem UUID: 6568895d-1c66-4bf7-9404-69412f5241c8
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
        32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
        4096000, 7962624, 11239424, 20480000, 23887872, 71663616, 78675968,
        102400000

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (262144 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
```
I will be doing this to the remaining logical volumes
Once that is completed, we would need to create and mount the volumes.

### 4. Mouting the Logical Volumes

 - #### Create Mount Points

    Create directories where the LV will be mounted, we will create the directories in the path > /mnt/data/<lv's> for data vol group and for the storage vol group we will create > /mnt/storage/<lv's>
    
  ``` bash
  #make sure to change the vms to your preffered name
  mkdir -p /mnt/data/vms 
  # mkdir - Make directory
  # -p - Create heirachy if the parent files are missing
  # data - directory named data to match vol group
  #vms - directory named vms for mounting
  ```


  - #### Mounting the logical volumes
  Once the mount drive directories are created, next step is to mount the logical volumes to the mount directory 

  Use the below command :
  
  ```bash
  #Replace the directory name to your preference
 mount /dev/vg_data/lv_vms /mnt/data/vms

# - mount > Mount Command
# - /dev/vg_data  --> Replace vg_data with volume group you created
# - /dev/vg_data/lv_vms  --> Replace lv_vms with your lgogical volume
# - /mnt/data/vms -- > Mounting the device to the mount directory we created

  ```
   -#### Verify the Mounts

   Once the drives have been mounted, ensure the mount status by running

   ```bash
   df -h
   # df -> disk free 
   # -h -> Listing output in human readable format
   ```

   The output would look similar to below lines depending on the drives and space your system has

   ```bash
   #OUTPUT - DO NOT RUN BELOW -- System Drives have been omitted

/dev/mapper/vg_data-lv_vms         2.5T   28K  2.4T   1% /mnt/data/vms
/dev/mapper/vg_data-lv_containers  492G   28K  467G   1% /mnt/data/containers
/dev/mapper/vg_data-lv_backups    1007G   28K  956G   1% /mnt/data/backups
/dev/mapper/vg_data-lv_nas         1.5T   28K  1.5T   1% /mnt/data/nas
/dev/mapper/vg_data-lv_logs        515G   28K  489G   1% /mnt/data/logs
/dev/mapper/vg_storage-lv_storage  1.3T   28K  1.2T   1% /mnt/storage/storage
   ```

### 5. Creating persistent mounting with <b>/etc/fstab</b>

To ensure the logical volumes are mounted automatically after a reboot, add them to the /etc/fstab file.Before we edit the fstab file, we will create a backup copy.
To make a copy of the fstab file :

```bash
cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
#To confirm that the files have been copied, check the directory
ls /etc/fst*
#output will be listed as below
>>>/etc/fstab  /etc/fstab.backup
```
The /etc/fstab file, also known as the "file systems table", contains information about all the available disk partitions and how they should be mounted on a Linux system during boot.

|<b>General Syntax</b>|
```bash
echo <device> <mount-point> <filesystem-type> <options> <dump> <pass> >> /etc/fstab
```
  1. -device - partition or the device to mount, here (/dev/vg_data/lv_vms)
  2. -mount-point - The directory where the device is mounted
  3. -filesystem-type - The file system type - here ext4
  4. -options - Default mount options like read-write
  5. -dump - determines whether filesystem should be backed by dump command, 0 disables.
  6. -pass - order in which the filesystems are checked, here 2 - meaning the filesytem is checked after root system

```bash
#Example
root@DVPROX01:~# echo /dev/vg_data/lv_vms /mnt/data/vms/ ext4 defaults 0 2 >> /etc/fstab
# /dev/vg_data/lv_vms > device partition location
# /mnt/data/vms/ > Mount Point
```

Test the updated configuration by running the following

```bash
mount -a
```
If no errors appear, the configuration is correct.

### 6. Verify the volumes created 

- Display volume groups
```bash 
vgdisplay
```
- Display logical volumes
```bash
lvdisplay
```
- Display mounted filesystems
```bash
df -h
```

We have completed the creation of logical volumes,formating and mounting the volumes created and creating persistent mount points by using etc/fsab.

### 7. Adding Directory in porxmox

Once created, you can add the volumes in proxmox by loging into the web interface

In the Proxmox web interface:
  - Navigate to Datacenter > Storage > Add > Directory.
  - Fill in the fields:

    - ID: A unique name for the storage (e.g., vms_storage).
    - Directory: The full mount path (e.g., /mnt/data/vms).
    - Content: Select the type of data to store based on the requirements

Save the configuration

 ![Proxmox_Directory_Add] ({{site.url }}/assets/posts/lvm_setup/ProxmoxDirAdd.png)
 
 Now you can create VMS,Containers,backups based on your needs.
 Again, this may not be the best approach, I wanted to try out to keep the storage seperated for multiple use.

Thank you!
